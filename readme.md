<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

40% of Britons havenâ€™t read a single book in the last 12 months and the in the UK, the average adult reads approximately three books per year, according to a recent poll by YouGov. I, on the other hand, read on average 19 a year. 

### Too Many Books

I suffer from a couple of problems where books are concerned. Firstly, books (that I'd like to read) are being published at a rate faster than I can read them, and secondly, I have a problem whereby if I see an autobiography of a contemporary musician, I have to have it. This all means that I have a very large backlog of books to read, and occasionally, I'd like to re-read some favourites too. Too many books, not enough time.

### Enter bookISBN2Task

I also suffer from not remembering just what books I own and what I might want to read next - enter bookISBN2Task.

I decided to write a simple little app that I could use to scan book bar codes and then record that book on my reading list. I am aware that I could do that using something like GoodReads but I didn't want to do that for a few reasons: 

* I didn't want to be tied in to the Amazon ecosystem for this
* I keep my reading list on Remember the Milk
* I wanted the challenge of writing it myself.

This simple little app uses the [Quagga](https://serratus.github.io/quaggaJS/) library to scan a barcode which is then decoded and sent to [Open Library](https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/books) to look up the details. You are then given then details of the book which you can then add to your reading list. At present supported is both Remember the Milk and a simple csv which you can also view through the app.
